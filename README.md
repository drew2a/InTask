My implementation of a several programming tasks from interview.

All examples: ![main.py](main.py)

#Matrices
## Spiral/snail matrix
Example of how to create matrix like this: <br>
9 8 7 <br>
2 1 6 <br>
3 4 5 
```python
def create_snail_matrix(size):
```

#Arrays
## Pairs
Find a pair of elements from an array whose sum equals a given number:
```python
def find_pairs(array, value):
```

## Left rotation
Example of a left rotation operation on an array: 
```python
def array_left_rotation(a, k):
```

## Sub array with max sum
How to find sub array with max sum: 
```python
def max_sum_sub_array(given_array):
```

#Sequences
## Print numbers can be divided by 3 and can not be divided by 5...
Example how to find numbers can be divided by 3 and can not be divided by 5.
Sum of all digits in each number is less than 10.
```python
def create_3_5_10_array(n):
```

#Trees
## Binary search tree
Check is this a binary search tree:
```python
def check_binary_search_tree(root):
```
